# Incident Watcher

The City of East Point (near ATL) recently open sourced their police incidents. This process will pull down recent police incidents and sends out a tweet if the incident occurred in my neighborhood (Jefferson Park). I am using PostGIS to select incidents within a shape file of my neighborhood.

Will update this as I progress on the various tasks.
