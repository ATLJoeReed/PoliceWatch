# Incident Watcher

The City of East Point (near ATL) recently open sourced their police incidents. This watcher will pull down recent police incidents and sends out alerts of any incident within a 1 mile radius of a specified location. It will also have an API that takes two parameters (center point (lat/long) and a mile radius) and will query the database for all police incidents within that radius.

Going to use Python/Flask and PostgreSQL.

Will update this as I progress on the various tasks.
