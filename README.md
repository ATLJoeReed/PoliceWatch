# PoliceWatcher

The City of East Point (ATL) recently open sourced their police activity. This watcher will pull down recent police activities and send out alerts of any activity within a 1 mile radius of my house. It will also have an API that takes two parameters (center point - lat/long and radius) and will query the database for all police activity within the radius.
